Hey guys,

Sorry to all the loyal customers out there. StakeReloadXS has closed down due to @sevellion who misled me for more than 18 months, and discovering that he shorted me in excess of $100,000. 

When I confronted him about it, he accused me of all sorts of improper things but refused to pay me. He then made public statements neglecting this $100,000 detail and promoting other bots before closing down. I don't want to name the bots but be sure that anything not coming directly from @jlucus / t.me/supitsj is most likely going to contain viruses or in the end short you for $100,000.

We're happy to resume business soon, though financially this is a difficult position to be in and we're open to discussing terms with any interested serious party.
